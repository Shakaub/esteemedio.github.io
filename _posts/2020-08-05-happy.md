A major challenge of digital staffing is helping employees thrive. As we face changes in how we do business, who we hire, and how we hire, are paramount.

Work-life balance is important in a time when the world seems unstable. Skilled employees seek creative ways to get work done, both in and out of the office.

So how can your business accommodate this new work-life balance and stay on task?

### What Is Work-Life Balance?

Balancing work, personal time, and family life is different for everyone. With some flexibility, it's possible to create [solutions for workers and employers](https://esteemed.io/blog/2020/08/01/can-remote-work-increase-employee-productivity/ "Learn more about work-life balance. "){:target='_blank'}.

> "As we look ahead, it is clear that in order to remain competitive, employers must find ways to offer flexible work options if they want to attract and retain top talent," said Hank Jackson, president and CEO of the [Society for Human Resource Management](https://www.shrm.org/ "Visit the Society for Human Resource Management."){:target='_blank'}.

For over a decade, we’ve worked with thousands of digital experts, and we know how hard it is to find the right people. For those hard-to-staff niches — like WordPress and Drupal — retention is even harder.

Both Gen Xers and Millenials list telework as a job requirement. For Gen Xers, work-life benefits include remote work and ample vacation time.

In five years, Millennials will make up 75% of the workforce. They’re not as frivolous as you think. They see careers as a method for supporting their lifestyle. The office ping-pong table is a thing of the past.

### Employee Happiness Statistics

The future of work lies in talented, distributed networks of eager problem-solvers. And when asked about how working remotely makes them feel, the results are in:

* In a survey from the State of Remote Work 2019 “83% of survey respondents agreed that the ability to work remotely would make them happier.”
* Full-time remote workers resoundingly replied that they were 22% happier in their jobs than those who had never worked remotely.
* In a report by PGI, 82% of distributed workers reported that telecommuting reduced their stress, and 80% reported that it improved their morale.

That boost in morale can make a huge difference to your bottom-line and your peace of mind.

### Happier Employees Are More Creative

Businesses who rely on distributed workforces see the benefits. Employees work from environments best suited to their tastes or moods.

Greater comfort boosts creativity and can lead to innovation. For many at the top of their fields, innovation brings greater job satisfaction.

And 1,100 US-based firms reported improved relations between managers and workers after going remote.

### The Impact of Employee Happiness on Productivity

“Research has shown that employees tend to be happier with flexible work environments. As an added bonus for employers, happier employees tend to be more productive, loyal, and have higher retention rates.”—TotalWellness

AI recruiters and algorithms still can’t find employees who will thrive in your business. The ghosts in the machine can only see so much about a person.

We’ve seen other professionals struggle with finding hires, evaluating their core strengths, and endless reviews with unqualified candidates.

We understand first-hand the challenges of finding the right talent for the job. But how often has a trusted colleague recommended a great hire?
