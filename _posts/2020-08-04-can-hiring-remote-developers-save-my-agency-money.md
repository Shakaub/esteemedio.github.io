Your business or agency may be making a critical decision to hire remote employees to help you grow. But many talented web developers and engineers have a backlog of clients. Just getting in contact with them can be a full-time job.

[Working with a distributed team](https://esteemed.io/blog/2020/07/08/5-benefits-of-a-distributed-workforce/ "Learn more about a distributed team."){:target='_blank'} may seem daunting, but many companies are already fully remote. We’re seeing the future of work change right before our eyes.

But, can employing distributed, remote web developers actually save you money? The short answer? Yes. And it will save you more than just that.

### **Save Yourself the Headache**

Time is money. Banging your head against a wall is not how you should be spending it.

We understand the frustration of [digital staffing](https://esteemed.io/blog/2020/08/03/should-i-consider-contract-staffing/ "Learn more about contract staffing. "){:target='_blank'}. We've made it our goal to remove the guesswork and pain points along the journey.

Demand for top-tier developers has never been higher, and we don’t want all the great talent out there to go to waste!

We understand that the best hires are scattered far and wide. That’s why we founded [Esteemed](https://esteemed.io/sales/schedule-demo/ "Schedule a demo!"){:target='_blank'}, our curated network of top-performing hires, all in one easy-to-access Slack channel.

For over a decade we’ve made it our mission to help businesses and agencies seamlessly harness the power of passionate problem-solvers.

And we’ve seen some pretty staggering results in the way business gets done.

### **Top Remote Web Developers Consider Remote a Benefit**

We’ve discussed the [effects remote work](https://esteemed.io/blog/2020/08/01/can-remote-work-increase-employee-productivity/){:target='_blank'}[ ](https://esteemed.io/blog/2020/08/01/can-remote-work-increase-employee-productivity/)has on employee productivity.

It’s no secret that remote teams work longer hours and are more willing to put in overtime than on-site employees.

Job flexibility is something that most top recruits look for today.

Global firms and agencies too have reported more positive relationships between managers and remote developers.

> “95% of employers say that telework has a high impact on employee retention.”— PGI.com

We see it every day on the happy faces of our clients and the [Esteemed Talent Network](https://esteemed.io/blog/2020/07/25/5-reasons-why-you-should-join-a-talent-network/){:target='_blank'}. That’s good business.

### **The Bottom-Line for Your Business or Agency**

What is the real bottom-line for your business? Output and efficiency are important factors in your success. That balance is crucial.

> “... A typical employer can save an average of $11,000 per half-time telecommuter per year. The primary savings are the result of increased productivity, lower real estate costs, reduced absenteeism and turnover, and better disaster preparedness.” —[Global Workplace Analytics](https://globalworkplaceanalytics.com/telecommuting-statistics){:target='_blank'}

Optimizing that path forward is an important step on the journey. By investing more in your talent, you actually save more. We can’t ignore the evidence. Save money and sanity by staffing smarter.
