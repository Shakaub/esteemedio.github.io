For many, waking up, having a coffee, and settling into work on the couch is an ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prompted by coronavirus, remote working has increased in 2020 and has made people stay in the confines of their homes. As a result, the daily work routines and tasks have been shifted to online, setting up a distributed workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what is a distributed workforce? Distributed workforce means something completely new: working remotely for your employer from a comfortable environment of your choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The typical mindset of jobs and office work has always been that an employee must get up early in the morning, commute to their desk, and work until late. But, today’s technology has made it simple after WiFi, remote desktop, and video-calling software. In a whirlwind few months, living rooms became home-offices, and bedrooms became private study rooms. Recent technological advancements have broken the mold, providing much-needed support to employers and employees seeking to avoid any interaction with the coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decades ago, when there was no such concept, work could be tedious and boring, going to the same place for years. Now, we cannot even think of living without these conveniences. Have you ever wondered why you shudder a bit when thinking about “no internet”, or “no smartphones or laptops”? It’s because their continual improvements only add benefit to our working lives! Let’s take a look at some of the most recent benefits of a distributed workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Employee Productivity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We all have been in that situation where our morning alarm was torture, right? Getting up from bed, and making it to the office can be quite a hassle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, many developers have been avoiding the traditional workplace for years. Working from home and being your own boss, allows people flexible, fun schedules. As long as working hours, preferences, and intended tasks is clear, all is well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a survey of 24,000 workers, employee productivity can be increased greatly, if the companies offer a pathway to a distributed workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One recent study reported that 53% of employees working remotely are willing to offer overtime, and 45% of remote workers are able to do more than they usually complete at the office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s no Jedi mind-trick, the creation of a distributed workforce can positively impacts your company’s output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Innovative Workplace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Companies who currently have a distributed workforce know the benefits. For workers, knowing that you have the flexibility to explore your ideas in different environments can help stimulate your creativity, or offer greater comfort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year in the US, 7% to 9 % of people switch to a distributed workforce. Now, Global Workplace Analytics reports that over the past 10 years, 91% of the total US population has started working in distributed workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talent &amp;amp; Skills at Your Doorstep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Recruitment processes critically evaluate a person’s entire work history, professional background, and personality. Candidates who appeared for interviews would go through a series of assessments to exhibit their skills and talents, but sometimes the selection could misappropriate their skills, and companies could appoint an unsuitable match. Imagine going through a long process, and still not getting your desired talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The distributed workforce has opened the field of freelancing, and people only appoint experts of particular subjects for their tasks by evaluating the experiences of other recruiters. Now, talent and skills can be shown in their personal portfolio available on their profiles, and you can go through it without them knowing about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Esteemed, we have full talent profiles available for any remote workers you may need, as well as entire teams in order to help your organization scale into new business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uninterrupted Working Hours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We’re humans. We get distracted. The office can be a blessing and curse. However, companies who offer flexible working policies do not deal with distracted workers. Can you imagine why that would be?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the office is a distraction for some, then, as a business owner, wouldn’t you want to place your much-appreciated employee in a setting that allows them to access their productivity? By giving them the choice of peaceful or stimulating spots like café, coffee shops, libraries, or even bedrooms, your workers can initiate their work with full concentration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No interruption in the working hours produces high-quality results and elevates a company’s profits by saving an annual amount of $11,000. As stated in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.owllabs.com/state-of-remote-work/2019&quot;&gt;State of Remote Work Survey&lt;/a&gt;, US corporations are saving a minimum of $4,000 to a maximum of $11,000 per year and getting even better services from staff members due to distributed workforce policies. The survey also reported that 44% of remote employees are less distracted when they work from their homes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved Business Success&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In 2020, the sudden shutdown of businesses decreased turnover ratio and profitability of many companies. Organizations who never considered distributed workforces were now facing a simple question: adapt, or be left in the dust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wanting to embrace the change, these organizations found their employees even happier than before. A survey by the State of Remote Work found that almost 1,100 US-based firms reported satisfactory relationships between managers and workers after implementing a remote-work program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many companies who adapted are now benefitting from these aforementioned benefits, as well as financial benefits. Inc. Magazine has reported that, on average, each remote worker is able to save around $2,000 to $4,000 a year.&lt;/p&gt;

If you’re a results-oriented programmer looking to bolster your portfolio or meet some new and amazing clients, we’d love to hear from you!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matthew Pritchard</name></author><category term="remote work" /><category term="working from home" /><summary type="html">To an outsider, being stuck in your home with free time and internet might sound like paradise.
