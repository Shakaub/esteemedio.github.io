Throughout the current economic uncertainty and global pandemic, remote work is on everyone’s mind. But should you embrace it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, allowing remote work for your teams and contractors might feel unsettling. But chances are your remote employees will thank you for trusting them to find their ideal working environment. Your business or brand might even see some big results by allowing #remotework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-boost-employee-productivity&quot;&gt;How to Boost Employee Productivity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Esteemed, we’re on a mission to help people around the world work smarter, not harder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For nearly a decade, we’ve been tracking how remote work positively impacts our network. Our colleagues and clients see the difference too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“65% of employees believe they’re more productive when they work outside of the office, and 47% wish their company provided this benefit.”—&lt;a href=&quot;https://clockify.me/blog/productivity/increase-employee-productivity/&quot; title=&quot;Marja Kojic's Biography&quot;&gt;Marija Kojic&lt;/a&gt;, Productivity Writer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the whole, remote teams get more done. And they do it all without a dreadful commute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-does-remote-work-help-skyrocket-performance&quot;&gt;Why Does Remote Work Help Skyrocket Performance?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WFA (Work from Anywhere) is the new WFH (Work from Home). Workplace elasticity lets you be your own boss, keep flexible hours, and focus on the tasks that matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most top-tier developers have avoided the traditional office for years. 44% of remote employees said they were less distracted when they worked from home. No more endless meetings, office distractions, or annoying coworkers. The bedroom is the new boardroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;employee-productivity-vs-hours-worked&quot;&gt;Employee Productivity Vs. Hours Worked&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One misconception about distributed teams is that they work fewer hours than their on-site counterparts. This is simply not true. Remote workers say they work more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.owllabs.com/state-of-remote-work/2019&quot; title=&quot;Remote Work Report&quot;&gt;40 hours per week&lt;/a&gt;, 43% more than on-site workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The State of Remote Work Survey discovered the biggest reasons employees choose remote work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Better work-life balance (91%)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increased productivity/better focus (79%)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Less stress (78%)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Avoiding a commute (78%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A distributed workforce can elevate a company’s efficiency, as well as boost employee morale and customer satisfaction. With flexible schedules, remote teams no longer need to worry about the yoke of the 9-to-5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;remote-work-productivity&quot;&gt;Remote Work Productivity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results are in. If brands want to get to the next level, they need to embrace remote work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Esteemed, we rub elbows with diverse, global digital rockstars every day. We see the benefits of WFA and distributed teams first-hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numerous studies have shown how much more productive, engaged, and effective employees can be when they’re empowered to choose where, when, and how they’ll get work done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;can-you-really-measure-employee-productivity&quot;&gt;Can You Really Measure Employee Productivity?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Productivity metrics and benchmarks will be different for every business. Your productive output and efficiency are important factors to your success, and that balance is delicate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Optimizing that path forward is an important step on the journey, and that’s why we can’t ignore the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“… A typical employer can save an average of $11,000 per half-time telecommuter per year. The primary savings are the result of increased productivity, lower real estate costs, reduced absenteeism and turnover, and better disaster preparedness.” —&lt;a href=&quot;https://globalworkplaceanalytics.com/telecommuting-statistics&quot;&gt;Global Workplace Analytics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But more than math, we’ve seen the difference in output first-hand, and the future is bright!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re in need of an extra pair of trusted hands, a technical expert, or a strategic advisor with one of your projects, &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re 13,000+ strong and growing, distributed, and experienced in all things digital.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Kelton Reid</name></author><summary type="html">Our new normal has many businesses and contractors rethinking the future of work.

Having started an agency in 2011, we have sponsored countless events, amassed an impressive list of clients and formed many relationships with top talent. We’re a community of pre-screened digital professionals spread across multiple disciplines and categories. We have practices focused on CMS (WordPress, Drupal, Sitecore, AEM and more), E-commerce, UX, and Cloud. We deliver our service via the tools our clients already use. Built on Slack our premier platform allows us to post open roles, communicate and collaborate with client employers and client providers. We can connect you with a potential hiring manager in minutes. A network of this type removes the burden of business development from a contractor and provides a host of other benefits even for those seeking full-time work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;less-time-searching-more-time-working&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Less Time Searching, More Time Working&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The job search process can be long and drawn-out with many interviews, conversations, and redundant screening. Even if you do find a great opportunity, you might repeat the same search process a few months later once your project wraps up. At Esteemed we vouch for you with our clients. To do that we screen and qualify your experience, offer feedback that we think will help, and connect you with new opportunities that will be a fit as they come through our pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we’re on Slack, our jobs are posted directly in their respective channels. Looking for new opportunities in Magento, or another related field? Fill out your profile, get in touch, and join the channel for your discipline (#magento, #drupal). Less time searching for jobs means more time focusing on learning new skills or having fun. That’s what we are all about, making work more flexible, abundant and fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stand-out-from-the-crowd&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stand Out from the Crowd&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our years in the digital space we find companies work with who they trust. When you join our talent network, you’re pre-qualifying yourself for open roles listed with Esteemed. Just by signing up and going through our vetting process you are verifying your skills to one of our leads. Our clients have come to trust these individuals as if they were their own staff. We try to keep the process as minimal as possible, yet a thorough review of everyone in the network is needed to make strong recommendations. From there you have access to mentorship, support, and collaboration with 500 peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;grow-your-own-network&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grow Your Own Network&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you join the Esteemed Talent Network, you gain access to hundreds on Slack and thousands in the network at large. Developers, architects, project managers and other digital professionals with a range of experience are available for questions, collaboration or even teaming up on a project that you might need help with. Got a quick question about &lt;a href=&quot;https://app.drupalcontractors.com/blogs/come-commerce-drupal-way&quot;&gt;Drupal Commerce&lt;/a&gt;? Reach out to one of our Drupal experts on our #drupal Slack channel and start a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Esteemed members are always happy to offer advice, insight, and support. We’re a friendly, open company and we pride ourselves on our ability to build relationships with quality talent and grow lasting connections—whether that be between employer clients or members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;join-our-inside-track&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Join Our Inside Track&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Esteemed, you can also gain access to opportunities not listed on job sites. More than half of job seekers report that their preferred source for finding jobs is online. The second most popular method? Hearing about jobs from a friend or trusted colleague. We keep a close eye on our current and potential clients, and often hear about their needs first. This means they come to us first before posting on LinkedIn, Indeed, or even on their own website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of our unique relationship with agencies and organizations, joining our talent network might even assist with transforming your skill-set to a new area. For example, a developer who may want to transition to Project Management or an Executive role. We have helped many in the network transition to related areas. We believe in doing what you love. For some, that can change over time. We are here to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-little-help-from-your-friends&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Little Help from Your Friends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a freelancer people can feel lonely, and lack a support system found in traditional settings. Even if you are on contract at a big company, you are still “a contractor.” Being part of Esteemed provides a large and diverse support system. Whether you are looking for a simple coding solution or a few extra hands, we’re here to help! We know that team camaraderie encourages confidence, increases access to knowledge, and invites shared experiences. We believe being part of a talent network means not only helping you get gigs, but helping scale and grow your skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;become-a-partner&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Become a Partner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, although not one of our five reasons to join, we find relationships are everything in the workplace. Our Internal Partners Program provides developers and small agencies of five or less with the resources they need at insider pricing. If you’re a sole developer or an agency who doesn’t want to turn down that big project, &lt;a href=&quot;https://esteemed.io/partners/partner-registration/&quot;&gt;let’s talk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our talent network is a place to explore opportunities, share ideas, meet new colleagues and join interesting projects. As we bring members from around the world together for collaboration, work, and networking we are committed to help contractors grow their business and those seeking full-time work find the employer of their dreams.

For many, waking up, having a coffee, and settling into work on the couch is an ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prompted by coronavirus, remote working has increased in 2020 and has made people stay in the confines of their homes. As a result, the daily work routines and tasks have been shifted to online, setting up a distributed workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what is a distributed workforce? Distributed workforce means something completely new: working remotely for your employer from a comfortable environment of your choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The typical mindset of jobs and office work has always been that an employee must get up early in the morning, commute to their desk, and work until late. But, today’s technology has made it simple after WiFi, remote desktop, and video-calling software. In a whirlwind few months, living rooms became home-offices, and bedrooms became private study rooms. Recent technological advancements have broken the mold, providing much-needed support to employers and employees seeking to avoid any interaction with the coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decades ago, when there was no such concept, work could be tedious and boring, going to the same place for years. Now, we cannot even think of living without these conveniences. Have you ever wondered why you shudder a bit when thinking about “no internet”, or “no smartphones or laptops”? It’s because their continual improvements only add benefit to our working lives! Let’s take a look at some of the most recent benefits of a distributed workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;employee-productivity&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Employee Productivity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all have been in that situation where our morning alarm was torture, right? Getting up from bed, and making it to the office can be quite a hassle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, many developers have been avoiding the traditional workplace for years. Working from home and being your own boss, allows people flexible, fun schedules. As long as working hours, preferences, and intended tasks is clear, all is well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a survey of 24,000 workers, employee productivity can be increased greatly, if the companies offer a pathway to a distributed workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One recent study reported that 53% of employees working remotely are willing to offer overtime, and 45% of remote workers are able to do more than they usually complete at the office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s no Jedi mind-trick, the creation of a distributed workforce can positively impacts your company’s output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;innovative-workplace&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Innovative Workplace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies who currently have a distributed workforce know the benefits. For workers, knowing that you have the flexibility to explore your ideas in different environments can help stimulate your creativity, or offer greater comfort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year in the US, 7% to 9 % of people switch to a distributed workforce. Now, Global Workplace Analytics reports that over the past 10 years, 91% of the total US population has started working in distributed workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;talent--skills-at-your-doorstep&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talent &amp;amp; Skills at Your Doorstep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recruitment processes critically evaluate a person’s entire work history, professional background, and personality. Candidates who appeared for interviews would go through a series of assessments to exhibit their skills and talents, but sometimes the selection could misappropriate their skills, and companies could appoint an unsuitable match. Imagine going through a long process, and still not getting your desired talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The distributed workforce has opened the field of freelancing, and people only appoint experts of particular subjects for their tasks by evaluating the experiences of other recruiters. Now, talent and skills can be shown in their personal portfolio available on their profiles, and you can go through it without them knowing about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Esteemed, we have full talent profiles available for any remote workers you may need, as well as entire teams in order to help your organization scale into new business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;uninterrupted-working-hours&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uninterrupted Working Hours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re humans. We get distracted. The office can be a blessing and curse. However, companies who offer flexible working policies do not deal with distracted workers. Can you imagine why that would be?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the office is a distraction for some, then, as a business owner, wouldn’t you want to place your much-appreciated employee in a setting that allows them to access their productivity? By giving them the choice of peaceful or stimulating spots like café, coffee shops, libraries, or even bedrooms, your workers can initiate their work with full concentration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No interruption in the working hours produces high-quality results and elevates a company’s profits by saving an annual amount of $11,000. As stated in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.owllabs.com/state-of-remote-work/2019&quot;&gt;State of Remote Work Survey&lt;/a&gt;, US corporations are saving a minimum of $4,000 to a maximum of $11,000 per year and getting even better services from staff members due to distributed workforce policies. The survey also reported that 44% of remote employees are less distracted when they work from their homes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;improved-business-success&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved Business Success&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020, the sudden shutdown of businesses decreased turnover ratio and profitability of many companies. Organizations who never considered distributed workforces were now facing a simple question: adapt, or be left in the dust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wanting to embrace the change, these organizations found their employees even happier than before. A survey by the State of Remote Work found that almost 1,100 US-based firms reported satisfactory relationships between managers and workers after implementing a remote-work program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many companies who adapted are now benefitting from these aforementioned benefits, as well as financial benefits. Inc. Magazine has reported that, on average, each remote worker is able to save around $2,000 to $4,000 a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking for remote opportunities in cutting-edge technologies? There’s no quicker or easier way to get onboard with some awesome remote work than by partnering with &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;Esteemed&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re a results-oriented programmer looking to bolster your portfolio or meet some new and amazing clients, we’d love to hear from you!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Matthew Pritchard</name></author><category term="remote work" /><category term="working from home" /><summary type="html">To an outsider, being stuck in your home with free time and internet might sound like paradise.
