        <p>Advancing your website’s speed is the ultimate goal of any WordPress user. Ideally, your intended users are able browse your website, and benefit from fast page-loading. Though various factors determine your WordPress website’s speed, things like web hosting and SEO play a critical role. Accelerating your WordPress website is important as it influences how users interact with your digital presence. So important, in fact, that over 53% of users leave websites that take <a href="https://www.marketingdive.com/news/google-53-of-mobile-users-abandon-sites-that-take-over-3-seconds-to-load/426070/">more than three seconds to load</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re having difficulty optimizing your WordPress sites, there are fortunately multiple online tools, as well as helpful tips and tricks, that can provide a wealth of information about speed and performance of your webpages.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at some of the recent breakthroughs to help you optimize your WordPress site’s performance.</p>

<p><img src="/img/blog-performance.jpg" alt="Increase WP performance" title="Increase WP performance" /></p>

<p><a href="https://stock.adobe.com/images/cloud-computing-technology/277292661?as_channel=affiliate&amp;as_campaign=pexels&amp;as_source=arvato&amp;tduid=03e84f70785ca47e6b51b260d9ac044e&amp;as_channel=affiliate&amp;as_campclass=redirect&amp;as_source=arvato">Image Source</a></p>

<p><strong>Why Is Speed Important For My WordPress Site?</strong></p>

<p>Research has revealed that <em>the average human attention span has decreased from 12 seconds to 7 seconds.</em></p>

<p>But how does this relate to you as a website owner?</p>

<p>The correlation is simple. A user will not be interested in your website if it requires long loading times.  <br />
You have, at most, three seconds to show your content.</p>

<p>Recently, <a href="https://www.fmemodules.com/de/blog/38-strangeloop-case-study---how-can-you-get-66-boost-in-conversions-by-implementing-quick-checkout">the StrangeLoop Case Study</a> audited Google, Amazon, and other web-giants. Researchers found that a one-second delay in page load could reduce conversions by 7%, a 16% drop-off in customers’ interest, and an 11% decline in page reviews.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, Google and other search engines don’t optimize websites that require considerable loading times, meaning sites with longer loading time will face difficulty generating organic traffic.</p>

<p>if you want more traffic for your website, or if you want to generate more revenue, then you need to make your WordPress website work faster!</p>

<p><strong>How to Test and Analyze Your WordPress Loading Time</strong></p>

<p>There are many tools and platforms available to test your loading times. We recommend looking into the following services, and choosing the one that works best for you.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Google Pagespeed Insights</li>
  <li>Gt matrix Tool</li>
  <li>Pingdom Tool</li>
  <li>Web Page Test</li>
</ul>

<p>In a matter of seconds, these tools produce data that can help you take action and speed up your WordPress site. If you’re just getting started with WordPress, do not assume that if your site loads, then the speed is acceptable. There are many factors involved in page loading, and these tools will allow you to see how your users interact with your site display times.</p>

<p><strong>Incredible Tips to Speed-Up WordPress Website</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Take Assistance of Your Cloud Hosting Provider</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Before you take any action to improve your WordPress website, it is strongly recommended to seek the assistance of WordPress Hosting Providers for their compatibility and familiarity with WordPress. They are proficient and can provide helpful tips about the improvement of your WordPress website.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Install an efficient Caching Plugin</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Another efficient and worthwhile practice to increase your WordPress website performance is to use a cache plugin. Using a caching plugin is tremendously advantageous as it stores the website’s final view for future visitors. Using a caching plugin doesn’t require your WordPress to regenerate it for visitors. This data may incorporate CSS code, HTML, Flash files, images, JS and font, etc.</p>

<p>In the earlier stages of your website build, the installation of a useful caching plugin will provide better performance and safeguard you from slow loads.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Optimize Your Visuals and Images</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Images not only give a new life to your website but also boost engagement. Research demonstrates that  using striking visuals can make your content eye-catching. In fact, 80% of people read through copywriting, or additional text-based content, when paired with appealing visuals.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, if you don’t pay any attention to image optimization, then it could be hurting for your website. Non-optimized images are one of the most significant speed issues for any WordPress beginner.</p>

<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Instead of uploading a picture directly from your photo gallery, it is strongly recommended to use any of the photo editing software that optimizes your web page as per the latest requirements. Photo editors can compress image size by up to 5x.</p>

<p>Keep following things in mind including;</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use Cdn for images</li>
  <li>Reduce https requests</li>
  <li>Use lazy loader</li>
  <li>Reduce page size</li>
</ul>

<p>To increase the WordPress performance and speed, use PNG and JPEG images. But what are the differences between the two? It’s a quite simple, but important distinction.</p>

<p>You <strong>cannot</strong> get compressed PNG images, as compressing PNGs results in lost information. An uncompressed image assures premium quality with more details.</p>

<p>JPEG images <strong>can</strong> be compressed easily and uploaded without difficulty due to their smaller size.</p>

<p><strong>Best Practices for Optimizing Your WordPress Performance</strong></p>

<p>After installing a caching plugin and optimizing your images, you will see significant improvements across your website. If you want to go above-and-beyond, and intend to improve your website performance like a pro, you must follow the practices mentioned below. Surprisingly, many of these practices are non-technical and can be implemented quickly without spending additional effort or time.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Frequently Update Your WordPress Website</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>For the best performance of your WordPress site, it is necessary to update as often as possible. Updating WordPress website not only includes updating the latest features, but also fixes bugs and other issues as well. There is a strong probability that your WordPress themes and plugins have the latest updates too.</p>

<p>Being a WordPress owner, it is your responsibility to update the website frequently. You must keep the WordPress website, plugin, themes, and caches updated according to the latest version. If you ignore the updates, it will make your website unpredictable and make you defenseless to security threats.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Compress Your Wordpress Website’s Size</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>If your website is a smaller size, it will be loaded without much effort. .</p>

<p>There are multiple methods for accomplishing this. For instance, you can use GZip compression to compress the size of the WordPress website upto 70%. A compressed website loads faster due to a significant diminution in bandwidth. An uncompressed website, on the other hand,  takes much longer to load, and if your visitors don’t like watching paint dry, then surely they won’t enjoy wasting their time as they wait for your website to load.  <br />
 <br />
So, if you are launching a new website, it is strongly recommended to compress its size according to the most up-to-date requirements.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Choose a Lightweight Theme</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>While the WordPress marketplace is full of amazing themes, remember that themes with multiple sliders, dynamic content, widgets, and sidebars can cause hosting servers to respond at a snail’s pace. Especially if you are just starting out with WordPress,  choose a lightweight theme for the best performance.</p>

<p><strong>Wrapping-Up</strong></p>

<p>Go ahead and must perform all the tips and practices as mentioned earlier. But don’t forget to analyze your WordPress website performance after the application of such tips. These are not words of mouth, because we are sure that after the application of these tips and practices, you will experience a significant boost in your WordPress performance.  <br />
